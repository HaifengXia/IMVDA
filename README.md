# IMVDA
This is the demo for IMVDA via CEKT.
# Datasets
[Office-31](https://faculty.cc.gatech.edu/~judy/domainadapt/) and [Office-Home](https://www.hemanthdv.org/officeHomeDataset.html) are popular datasets for domain adaptation, which only includes RGB images.

RGB-D and B3DO are public available datasets with RGB and Depth images. Note that the original depth images should be processed and then are fed into the network.
